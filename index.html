            <li>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</li>
            <li>
              In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes.
              Each result get added to his ROUND score
            </li>
            <li>
              BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After
              that, it's the next player's turn
            </li>
            <li>
              The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score
              gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's
              turn
            </li>
            <li>
              The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the
              game.
